<p>M64 files consist of a 1024-byte header with various blocks that depend on settings, followed by some input data.
</p><h3><a id="HeaderFormat"></a>Header format</h3><div class="deeper">
<pre>  000 4-byte signature: 4D 36 34 1A "M64\x1A"
  004 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: version number, should be 3
  008 4-byte little-endian integer: movie "uid" - identifies the movie-savestate relationship,
                                    also used as the recording time in Unix epoch format
  00C 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: number of frames (vertical interrupts)
  010 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: rerecord count
  014 1-byte unsigned int: frames (vertical interrupts) per second
  015 1-byte unsigned int: number of controllers
  016 2-byte unsigned int: reserved, should be 0
  018 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: number of input samples for any controllers
  01C 2-byte unsigned int: movie start type
     value 1: movie begins from snapshot (the snapshot will be loaded from an externalfile
                                          with the movie filename and a .st extension)
     value 2: movie begins from power-on
     other values: invalid movie
  01E 2-byte unsigned int: reserved, should be 0
  020 4-byte unsigned int: controller flags
     bit 0: controller 1 present
     bit 4: controller 1 has mempak
     bit 8: controller 1 has rumblepak
     +1..3 for controllers 2..4.
  024 160 bytes: reserved, should be 0
  0C4 32-byte ASCII string: internal name of ROM used when recording, directly from ROM
  0E4 4-byte unsigned int: CRC32 of ROM used when recording, directly from ROM
  0E8 2-byte unsigned int: country code of ROM used when recording, directly from ROM
  0EA 56 bytes: reserved, should be 0
  122 64-byte ASCII string: name of video plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
  162 64-byte ASCII string: name of sound plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
  1A2 64-byte ASCII string: name of input plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
  1E2 64-byte ASCII string: name of rsp plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
  222 222-byte UTF-8 string: author name info
  300 256-byte UTF-8 string: author movie description info
</pre></div><h3><a id="ControllerData"></a>Controller Data</h3><div class="deeper">
After the header, starting at byte 0x400 in the file, comes the input 
data. (NOTE: If the version number at 0x004 is 1 or 2, then the input 
data starts at byte 0x200 instead.) The input data is a stream of 4-byte
 bitvectors which indicate which buttons and/or analog directions are 
pressed at each point in time.
<p></p><table class="wikitable" border="1"><tbody><tr><th> 000-001</th><th>  002</th><th>  003</th></tr>
<tr><td>  Buttons</td><td>  Analog X</td><td>  Analog Y</td></tr>
</tbody></table><p>Analog values are signed (-128 to 127), with up and right being positive.
</p><p>For buttons, each value is determined by OR-ing together values for whichever of the following are pressed:
</p><p></p><pre>   0x0001 C-Right
   0x0002 C-Left
   0x0004 C-Down
   0x0008 C-Up
   0x0010 R
   0x0020 L
   0x0040 (reserved)
   0x0080 (reserved)
   0x0100 Digital Pad Right
   0x0200 Digital Pad Left
   0x0400 Digital Pad Down
   0x0800 Digital Pad Up
   0x1000 Start
   0x2000 Z
   0x4000 B
   0x8000 A
</pre>They will come in groups of however many controllers the game 
happens to check (note that it will never check disabled/disconnected 
controllers), in whatever order the game happens to check them. There is
 absolutely no way to correlate the amount of input data with the length
 of the movie, because the N64 may check input many times in 1 frame or 
it may not check any input at all for a large number of frames, or 
anything in-between.
<p>Mupen64 will trigger a power off/on reset when the value for the 
controller info is specifically set to Reserved1 = 0x01, and Reserved2 =
 0x01. The controller info is then cleared from being sent to the PIF 
RAM to avoid errors. This feature is only available in Mupen64 
ReRecordingV2 and later versions.
