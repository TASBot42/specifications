\section{Functional purpose}
The TASBot64 is a device that plugs in a Nintendo 64 to play a pre-recorded Tool
Assisted Speedrun (TAS) input file, faking a gamepad.

A TAS is a speedrun (the completion of a video game in the shortest time
possible) whose inputs, that is to say the sequence of buttons pressing and
movements on the gamepad, are given frame-by-frame on an emulator.

Emulators enable techniques such as frame-by-frame operation, precise digital
and analog inputs, re-recording (saving and reloading the entire state of the
game at any moment) or even memory watching and disassembly.

Thanks to this, TASs showcase feats unattainable to the human player and often
feature blatant abuse of the game mechanisms, exploiting bugs in the games that
was not intended to receive such fast and improbable input.

If the emulator is needed to craft the input file, the sequence of inputs itself
however is perfectly valid and theorically could come from a real gamepad. Hence
the goal of the TASBot64, that is to perform a TAS on a real Nintendo 64 instead
of an emulator, thus validating that the TAS does not depend on any emulator
specificity.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item Behave as a genuine Nintendo 64 gamepad
\item Read and play the Mupen64-rr input file format from a SD card
\item Allow selecting between different files on the SD
\item Allow selecting between 50Hz (Europe) and 60Hz (US and Japan) operation
\item Display the name of the current selected file
\item Display errors or unsupported features if they occur
\item Allow passthrough of a gamepad to the console to avoid frequent unplugging
\item Take its power from the Nintendo 64 (no power source required)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performances}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user must be able to choose between 4 different input files
\item The TASBot64 must support input files as big as 4GB
\item The output stream to the console must be fast enough so as to not miss a
  game frame: a complete input frame must be emited in less than a 60th of a
  second.
\item The output stream rate must not drift more than half a frame (at most 8ms)
  in a runtime of 24 hours
\item The delay between startup of console and first output frame must be
  shorter than 0.5s and must not vary more than a quarter of a frame (at most
  4ms) between runs
\item The latency between input and output during passthrough must be less than
  1 ms
\end{itemize}

\section{User manual}
\subsection{Error}
\subsubsection{TAS mode}
\begin{itemize}
\item TAS doesn't start, no input play : Check if the switch is on TAS mode
\item TAS don't work, desync : Check if the right game is selected, restart the game
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Passthrougt mode}
\begin{itemize}
\item I can't play : Check if the switch is on Passthrought
\item I can't move : Check if controller is connected.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error Code}
\begin{itemize}
\item Error #000 : insert SDCARD in the slot
\item Error #001 : Error while parsing TAS file, make sure the SDCARD is format in fat32 and the input file is .m64
\item Error #002 : SD card is empty, put a file in the SD card
\end{itemize}
